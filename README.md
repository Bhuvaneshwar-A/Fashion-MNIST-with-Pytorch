# Fashion-MNIST-with-Pytorch

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. I classify the image using pytorch and the model gives good accuracy.
